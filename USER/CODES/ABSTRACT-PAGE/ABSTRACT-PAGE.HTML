                This project study, entitled "Sharma Burger ala Lasagna," 
                is a food product that combines well-known delicacies from
                 all around the world into a single product. We decided to merge 
                 those three foods in order to create a unique product. We utilized 
                 mashed potato for the bun, instead of the traditional bun that you 
                 would expect to see in the burger structure, and we accompanied it
                  with a sauce. This product may be recommended for the masses 
                  because of its affordable price, which is within the reach of most
                   people's budgets and also worth the expense of purchasing. It also
                    has a lot of benefits because the food is fresh and tasty.
                     The purpose of this research is to determine if the Shawarma
                      Burger ala Lasagna is feasible in the market. The main focus
                       area will be the Liceo de Cagayan University-Main Campus, 
                       which is located at Kauswagan High-Way and Rodolfo N. Pelaez
                        Blvd. According to the researchers, the population of Liceo de
                         Cagayan University Main Campus, according to the researchers,
                          will be a tremendous market for Shawarma Burger ala Lasagna, 
                          which is an opportunity that should not be missed. Furthermore, 
                          they would be suitable customers in assessing whether or not 
                          selling our product is indeed a feasible option in the near future.
                           The study will be carried out via a comprehensive online survey,
                            which allows us to make the assumption that selling Shawarma
                             Burger ala Lasagna is feasible and profitable. With a total 
                             of 100 participants, they will be selected from grades 11 and
                              12 ABM, STEM, and COA to ensure that each grade level and
                               strand is adequately represented. Following the collection
                                of data and findings, the researchers' analysis and computation
                                 demonstrate that the sales of Shawarma Burger ala Lasagna are 
                                 feasible and profitable in the market.
